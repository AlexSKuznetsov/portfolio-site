    I can tell that it is not so easy to choose if you are not familiar with programming
    languages and you don`t have years of experience with different projects and
    customers. Luckily I have both, and you don't need to spend years researching
    and preparing. What. Building marketing site with moder tech stack: Astro build
    for ultra-fast sites with a minimum amount of javascript. Excellent for building
    a company profile or single product page. Next.js - Bigger sites with lots of
    business logic. Excellent for large projects and E-commerce. Headless CMS - Sanity
    or Storyblok Full control of content in your hand
